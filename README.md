This repository only contains infrastructure and metadata for building the Entity Framework Core and the Entity Framework 6 API reference documentation. Changes to the actual contents of the API documentation need to be made [in the source code of EF Core](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore) or [in the source code of EF6](https://github.com/dotnet/ef6).

See [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.
